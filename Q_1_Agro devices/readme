Title: Smart Wi-FI based froming.
The motivation behind this smart device to monitoring the soil moisture, humidity in the forming. And what ever the data is coming from the 
device, which would be stores in the cloud service.

Microprocessor/Microcontroller:
In this device, i have used ESP8266 Wi-Fi module which is also contains GPIO pins. And these GPIO pins we can use as input and output.
it provides inbuild Wi-Fi module and easy to available in the market with optimum cost.

What do you use for the cloud part ? 
Cloud used to aggregate data from tools like soil sensors, to help farmers make better decisions about managing their crops, like how much 
water is required for the crop, how much moisture containe by soil etc.
We used ESP8266 as a server to send the data over the internet. And data finally will be show on the android cell phone screen.
