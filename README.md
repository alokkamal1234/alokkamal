Design a led matrix of 1024 leds
for creating 1024 led matrix,i have used multiplexing shifting method.
I have written this code on Arduino IDE. And just printed the world "ALOK".
I have used these 1024 leds in 16X64 matrix i.e 16 rows and 64 columns.
Each row contains 64 leds. For each row use single shiftresister. And total used shift resisters are 8.
